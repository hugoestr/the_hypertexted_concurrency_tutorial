## How to use it

The book is organized in a series of tutorials. Each tutorial covers a subject. These are hand on tutorials meant for you to work through the content as you read them.

To get started pick a tutorial. If something is unclear or you wish to learn more about it, click on the hyperlinks. That will take you to content that goes deeper into the topic.

If you are new to concurrency programming or the actor model, follow the first tutorial. Otherwise pick whatever interests you.

If you are curious on how the books is put together, read goals and pedagogy

## Goals  and Pedagory

This is a hyperlinked book on concurrency programming. It is mainly meant as a practical tutorial and guide for working programmers. The main content consist in an hands-on introduction to concurrent programming via Elixir. 

As you read, if you want to dive deeper into a subject, you can follow the hyperlinks. Eventually you will see examples in other languages. Eventually you will see other solutions to concurrency. You can go as deep as you want or skip it and focus on learning skills.

Why Elixir? I picked Elixir because I personally find it to be one of the simplest and most practical ways of doing concurrent programming. 

Why hypertexted? I decided that a hypertext book solves a problem that occurs frequently with books meant for the working programmers. On the one hand the reader wants to learn the skill quickly if they need to apply for their work. On the other,  hthere is often a desire, sometimes a need, to dive deeper into a topic. 

Why tutorials? My belief is that we learn coding best by doing, seeing code samples, running then, and then playing with the content.
